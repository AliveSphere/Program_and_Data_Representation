1. There was no error when I commented out #include <iostream>.
2. There were 11 errors when I commented out the using namespace std;. String objects, vector objects, and things like endl and cout no longer work, because they are part of the code included in the std namespace.
3. Why are the names case sensitive in this program? I know that a and A have different ascii code, but wouldn't it be a simple matter to make both a and A an acceptable start to the name Alex?
